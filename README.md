# Advent Of Code

This repository contains the code I wrote for the online [Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com)
by Eric Wastl. Advent of Code is a programming project where you are given one new puzzle everyday all throughout
December - it is "an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles". Puzzles can be solved using any programming language and they train you in various skills and algorithms.

Each day, a 2-parts problem is posted. Solving each part gives you 1 gold star (so you have up to 2 for each problem).

For more info on the project, take a look at [the about page](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).

Big thanks to [Eddie Li](https://github.com/xdl) for introducing me to this neat project!

## Repo organization
The Github repository is subdivided per year, then by language. For now, I've only worked in Python and mostly on
the current 2019 challenges. I will keep on filling the repository as I code up solutions in other languages or for
more challenges :)

Each ``year > language`` subfolder also contains its own README that contains some small notes, remarks, personal
interrogations or tips & tricks.

## Philosophy
I had multiple goals when I started this project:
- I wanted to improve my own skills with these challenges
- I also wanted to share with you little tips and tricks depending on the programming language
- and finally I wanted to offer some commented and (hopefully!) well-structured code to give you
  an example of some possible programming guidelines *(but this is by no means an imperative and each
  programmer might have their own preference, so this is just one example!)*
